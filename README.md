Please find below your assignment to be considered for next rounds:-

You will be shortlisted for a live coding round based on this task only.

Take a look at the attached UI image. Basically it's a password protected entry for lab members. Ignore the header and cross (close). You can even ignore the left images or choose your own.

It is static, so only one user account will be there for this test. You may hardcode that in code.

User Stories:
Users are allocated a fixed amount of time, for example: 10mins.
Users can input the correct password to enter the lab.
If the password is wrong, show some error like you have entered an incorrect password.
if password is correct, create a rotating and fade animation for the center circle, and the both doors should slide to both sides. The effect should look like a sliding door with a lock at the center. You may have seen this in sci-fi movies.

Once inside the lab, the time will start to decrease.
Inside the lab there will be only two features, current time remaining and exit button. The design for those doesn't matter.
If the user exited the lab, he will be shown this page with password entry again, with current remaining time.
If the user exhausted his time limit, he will be automatically exited from the lab.
If the user exhausted his time limit, he cannot login to the lab - show some error that you have exhausted your allocated time.

Quality of your code matters.

defaut password is  pass
password = pass
